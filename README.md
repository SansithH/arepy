# arepy

## Description
This module can be used for analysis of the Arepo files and snapshots.
It is primarily written in Python (v3.7+) and could be directly used as a Python module.
One can directly include it into the $PYTHONPATH variable through `.bashrc`:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/path/to/module/
```
It also uses Bash scripts so it can be directly operated from the terminal without any GUI.
